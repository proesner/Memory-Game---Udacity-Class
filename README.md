Paul's Concentration Game
10/2017

Rules of the game:
Concentration is a card game where all of the cards are shuffled and are laid face down on a surface in orderly rows and columns.
Each turn, two cards are flipped over. If the cards do not match,
they are both turned back face down.

Requirements to play the game:
1. Latest (JS enabled) web browser with an internet connection
2. Browser than can render and understand HTML5/CSS3
3. Javascript

Instruction to run the game:
1. Unzip the game files
2. Open the unzipped folder. Find index.html. Double click, or open from your favorite browser

Challenges making the game:
1. Countdown timer to display the same value from header to game winning modal window. Had to change where the second counter was called. Fix: Moved to out of the timer function and into the setInterval variable
2. Use to using Font Awesome for work. Wanted to use another 3rd party for the fun of it. However, some permission issues restricted me. After about 1hr of fussing with it, I went to Font Awesome
3. Syncing the card animations proved to be very diffcult. Hard to test and verify changes as I went along. Too many factors like click, match, no match scenarios

Fun aspects of the game:
1. Trying different aspects of card animations
2. Styling the board game. Commented/linked in CSS file on an awesome 3d effect I never had time for
3. Building the simple DOM and letting JS build upon that was fun in the sense that there is a set of logic I'm building that will manipulate the display layer, in which will alter the expeience the user is having.
